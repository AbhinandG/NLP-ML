83,AnonymousbutDilpreet,7 May 2021,"not big fan action movies. reason is- don't offer anything new always believe there's limit much enjoy them. Beyond certain point, become monotonous.Coming Kaithi, got many things right action films usually don't. One fact not lose plot badly. director smart enough not include lousy action scenes, flashbacks, pointless comedy. action limited doesn't get repetitive. For average Indian, may look grim goresome, but fans genre, may seem mild.I didn't like characters. They not good enough love but not bad enough hate either, i.e, lack depth. Action not top-notch, it's okayish. Plot-line thin but it's not bad thing all. But action movie,     minutes much liking.And big question is, worthy  . /  ? Well, much Thadam Ratchasan. It's high time stop promoting mediocre films. Many Tamil/Telugu movies last   years got ludicrously high ratings, one no exception. IMDB ratings lost relevance completely.     found helpful.
